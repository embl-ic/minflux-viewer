"""
minflux_viewer.core.format_sniff
=================================
Identify a file's real format from its **content** (magic bytes / structure),
independent of its extension. Used to recover from mislabelled files — e.g. a
``.json`` that is actually a NumPy ``.npy`` array, or a data file dropped with
no extension at all.

``sniff_format(path)`` returns one of:

    "npy" | "npz" | "mat" | "xlsx" | "tiff"  — binary, identified by magic bytes
    "zarr"                                  — canonical Zarr directory
    "json" | "delimited"                 — text, identified by structure
    None                                 — unrecognised

Binary results are *authoritative* (magic bytes don't lie); the caller may use
them to override a wrong extension. Text results are advisory — used only when
the extension is otherwise unknown.
