minflux_viewer.plugins
=======================
Plugin infrastructure for the MINFLUX Data Viewer.

A *plugin* is anything that extends the viewer with optional functionality
that is only loaded when the user invokes it from the **Plugins** menu.
Each plugin exposes:

* A short human-readable ``NAME`` (used as the menu item label).
* A ``TOOLTIP`` (shown on hover).
* A ``launch(state, parent)`` callable that opens its UI. The callable
  receives the active :class:`AppState` and an optional parent widget
  (usually the main window).

Registration
------------
Plugins are registered by calling :func:`register` at import time. The
main window imports :mod:`minflux_viewer.plugins` during startup, which
in turn triggers the registration of every built-in plugin.

Third-party plugins can be added without touching the core by importing
the package and calling ``plugins.register(...)`` from their own
``__init__.py``.

Usage from the main window
--------------------------

    plugins.ensure_loaded()
    for entry in plugins.available():
        action = QAction(entry.name, self, triggered=lambda _=False, e=entry: e.launch(self._state, self))
        plugins_menu.addAction(action)
