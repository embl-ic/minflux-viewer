"""
minflux_viewer.analysis.method_text
====================================
Compile a publication-style *Methods* paragraph from selected **Log events**.

The user picks the log events relevant to a dataset/method (auto-tagged with the
active dataset at emit time); each event is mapped — via a small regex rule
registry — to a prose sentence, grouped by processing stage. Rules can read the
dataset's current metadata for richer detail than the log string carries. Events
that match no rule are kept verbatim so nothing is lost.

Citations are ``(reference_text, url|None)`` tuples: paper-backed methods carry a
verified DOI (rendered as a hyperlink in the HTML output, inline as plain text in
the text output); custom in-house methods (anisotropy, NPC) carry an inline
methodology note with ``url=None``. Two formatters share :func:`_collect` —
:func:`generate_method_text` (plain) and :func:`generate_method_html` (links).
Pure Python (no Qt) → unit-testable.
