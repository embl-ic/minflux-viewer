"""Pytest-wide setup.

**Isolate preferences from the developer's real config.** The application stores
its preferences via ``QSettings("EMBL-IC", "MinfluxViewer")`` — on Windows that is
the registry (``HKCU\\Software\\EMBL-IC\\MinfluxViewer``), a *single shared location*
with no per-run isolation. ``MainWindow.closeEvent`` calls ``AppState.save_prefs()``,
and several tests deliberately set headless flags (e.g. ``show_render=False``,
``show_data_info=False``) before closing a MainWindow. Without isolation, simply
*running the test suite* overwrites the user's real "open render view on load"
preference.

``QSettings.setDefaultFormat`` does **not** affect the 2-arg ``QSettings(org, app)``
constructor (it stays ``NativeFormat``), and ``setPath`` is ignored for the Windows
registry — so redirecting QSettings itself does not work. Instead we patch the two
``AppState`` persistence methods (the only pref read/write path) to use a throwaway
temp file for the whole test session.
